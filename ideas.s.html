<h2>Malala Yousafzai</h2>
<h3> Malala Yousafzai is a girl who was born in Mingora, Pakistan. In Pakistan, the taliban ruled and placed
    strict rules on what women could or could not do. Many women were not allowed to recieve an education, or even step
    foot out of the house without a man present. Even with her country against her, she still fought and supported womens
    rights to an education. One day, on her way to school, she was shot in the head by the Taliban. Miraculously, she 
    survived and went on to created the Malala Fund, which is an organization that helps women across the world recieve
    an education. She is the youngest person to recieve a nobel peace prize.

<h2>What can I take from her story?</h2>
<h3> We can see through her story that Malala Yousafzai went through alot of stress and trauma in her life, 
    all at the age of 15. Even though her government was against her and she would have to face harsh consequences
    for going against them, she still fought for what she believed in. And in doing so, she changed countless lives 
    for the better. Even through situations that seem inevitable, giving up should never be an option. If you feel as 
    if the world is against you, never stop fighting. As long as you never stop trying, as long as you always take a step 
    forward, you will always be a step closer to the person you want to be.

<h2>Temple Grandin</h2>
<h3>Temple Grandin is a woman who is an animal behavorist who wrote countless research papers on animal behavior. she
    is a big advocate for the humane slaughter of animals for consumption. Temple Grandin is extremely 
    accomplished, but it wasnt easy for her in the slightest. Temple Grandin was diagnosed with autism.
    She has stated about how she felt different all her life, and people often didnt take her work seriously
    because of her condition. Temple Grandins autism makes her extremely visual. With this, she was able
    to see patters in animal behaviors that others could not. She became a public speaker for autism
    awareness and continues to fight for the humane processing of animals.
</h3>

<h2>What can I take from her story?</h2>
<h3>Temple Grandin was born different. Many people often treated her as less because of her condition.
    Even though she was different, she found a way to use her condition to aid in her goals that she achieved.
    Many saw her condition as a negative, but she turned it into a positive. You can do the exact same thing.
    whatever you may feel is different about you, just know that this difference doesnt have to hold you back.
    You can find a way to make this difference useful to you, and even show others that there are advantages in
    everything you dont expect. Yes, some differences can make it more difficult to do certain things, but 
    thats the beauty of being different. Never let your negative differences hold you back. Some may have
    to work harder than others, but you could always reach your goals, no matter where you start.

<h2>J.K Rowling</h2>
<h3>You may ask, "How can someone so rich and famous possibly relate to struggle?". Well, before
    creating Harry Potter, she wasnt even close to rich and famous. She was actually quite the opposite.
    J.K Rowling was going through a divorce and relied on government aid to support her. She could just 
    barely put food on the table each night for her and her family. She struggled with severe depression 
    after her divorce and all the publishers rejecting her stories. She didnt let her depression stop her
    from creating Harry Potter: The Philosipher's Stone.   
</h3>
 

<h2>What can I take from her story?</h2>
<h3>
    J.K Rowling is an incredible inspiration to battling mental illness. Depression can make someone feel
    useless, powerless, unworthy of family or society. It can be difficult battling these thoughts and feelings,
    But if she decided to listen to these thoughts and feelings, we wouldnt have had the stories we
    know and love today. Any mental illness can cause you to feel like your not good enough, or unworthy
    of this world. Do not listen to these thoughts. They only cause you to believe in something that is not
    reality. Battling through these thoughts can be the hardest thing one can do, but after the battle,
    you will live a life full of joy and creation of your own. In J.K Rowlings words:
</h3>

<h3><span class="resort"> "“I have never been remotely ashamed of having been depressed. Never. What’s 
     to be ashamed of? I went through a really rough time and I am quite proud that I got out of that.”"</span>
</h3>
