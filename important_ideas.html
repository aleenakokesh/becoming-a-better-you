<h2>Idea #1: Drinking enough water and eating healthy</h2>
<h3>
    Now, this may sound like slapping a band-aid over a larger issue,
    but drinking enough water and eating healthy actually can help
    level your moods, which can make it easier to handle stresssful 
    situations.

<h2>Idea #2: Find a new hobby</h2>
<h3> Many people often find themselves bored, or tired with
     there routine that theve been doing for years. A healthy change
     to that routine, like picking up a hobby or trying something new,
     can easily add some joy into your life that was missing.

<div id="talk" alt="talking to a friend"></div>

<h2>Talking to someone</h2>
<h3> People are always scared to talk about how they truly feel
     on the inside. It is a scary thing to open up to someone about
     things that the listener may not be able to relate to. The fear of 
     judgment is also a reason why people wouldnt want to speak up
     about there issues. You will never be able to change whats bothering
     you without acceptance and actions to change it. Speaking to a trusted
     friend or therapist could make you feel like a weight has been lifted
     from the burden thats been carried.

<div id="break" alt="taking a break"></div>

<h2>Taking breaks and Time Away</h2>
<h3>Many people do not realize how helpful mental health days are,
    or just taking time away for yourself to "recharge". Make time for 
    yourself. Take a day, or even just a few hours of your time to do what
    makes you feel your best. Wether thats cleaning your room, watching a movie,
    or ditching social media for a while. These things can help take away
    from some of the stressful environments in your life.
