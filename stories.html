<h2>Idea #1: Always make sure your eating healthy and staying hydrated</h2><br>
<h3>
    Most people who dont feel like themselves anymore may not feel like themselves for a reason: and 
    that specific reason is commonly overlooked. Now you may think this reason is just slapping a 
    band-aid over a bigger issue, but it actually may help with irritability and energy-levels all together.
    According to Harvard Health Publishing: "Researchers found that a healthy diet (the Mediterranean diet
    as an example) was associated with a significantly lower risk of developing depressive symptoms." 
    Of course, no one is expected to be perfect, but as long as you eat some nutritious food and drink 
    water every now and then, your moods will begin to stable and you will get more energy to feel 
    like yourself again.
