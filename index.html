<h3>Hello, Ive come to believe that you are here for a <span class="resort">reason.</span> I know that reason is you want a new way to see your life.
   Maybe your stress seems like its a mile high all the time, and you want it to go away. Maybe work or school makes you feel
   like your preformance is all your worth. Maybe even something happened in your life that causes you to feel guilt, regret, 
   frustration, or sadness. All of these situations and emotions can warp your perception of yourself, and reality. We are 
   here to help you cope with these emotions and situations, and to sprinkle a little bit of inspiration in your life.
    We want to show you that these feelings and situations do not last forever. It is okay to not be okay 100% of the time.
    Take some time to browse through this site. Look at all the ideas and persectives you can impliment into your life.
